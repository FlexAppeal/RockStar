## Example

```Swift
let
```

## Installation

Rockstar is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

Rockstar is in Alpha now, it will be developed a lot before a stable API has been achieved.
If you'd like to use Rockstar it's recommended to lock to minor versions for now.

```ruby
pod 'Rockstar'
```

or

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/RockStarSwift/RockStar.git", from: "0.3.0")
```
